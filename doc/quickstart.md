# Quickstart

SQLFlow is currently under active development. For those are interested in trying
it out, we have provided a prompt demo.

1. Install Go: https://golang.org/doc/install#install
1. Follow the instruction at `doc/build.md` to setup MySQL server and Docker container
1. In the docker container, run `go run cmd/demo/main.go`.

You should be able to see the following prompt

```
sqlflow> 
```

Play around with it. Any bug report and issue are welcomed. :)
